\papertitle{The logical form of action sentences}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The goal of Davidson is to provide a coherent theory of action sentences which
describes how to bring an action sentence to its logical form.

First, several earlier attempts to bring action sentences into a logical form
are discussed. Kenny has proposed that `$x$ did $p$' may be replaced by
`$x$ brings it about that $p*$', where $p*$ is the result of doing $p$ (Chisholm
has devised several minor variations to this approach). Since this replaces
the act of doing $p$ by the result of doing $p$, information about doing $p$
is necessarily lost. Von Wright's attempt is to also include the state
\emph{before} doing $p$ in the replaced form; information is still lost.
