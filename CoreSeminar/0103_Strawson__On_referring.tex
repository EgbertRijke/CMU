\begin{document}
\maketitle

Strawson argues that Russel's theory of Descriptions is not in agreement with
how people use language to state propositions with reference to individuals
or objects. He points out that for each expression (in his usage: phrase) or 
sentence we should distinguish
\begin{enumerate}
\item the expression or sentence;
\item uses of the expression or sentence;
\item utterings of the expression or sentence.
\end{enumerate}
According to Strawson, the meaning of an expression or sentence consist of the
ways one may use it to make an assertion about something, which is quite 
radically a different point of view than Russell's.
